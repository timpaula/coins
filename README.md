This is a simple command line game for two people playing on the same computer.
You can choose every turn which column you want to put your coin into. 
You win if you get four of your coins in a row, column or diagonal, before your teammate.
Enjoy! :)

This coin game was built with TDD and Clean Architecture.
It's still under progress, but already had a lot of fun programming it.
Please if you have any suggestions let me know.
